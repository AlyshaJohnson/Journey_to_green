            <h2>Upping your Recycling Game <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle"></i></h2>
            <p>Recycling can be mind boggling. There are so many elements to it and many questions that come up. How do
                you know what is and isnâ€™t recyclable? What do those symbols on packaging mean? What does my local
                authority accept?
                It is easy to get confused and potentially give up.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This article will give you some guidance on where to start or, if you already recycle, improve what you
                do now. I am going to break down how to find out what your local council accepts, what to do with items
                that they do not accept.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some typical items you would want to put into your recycling bin:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th><h2>Material</h2></th>
                    <th><h2>Typical Items</h2></th>
                    <th class="comment"><h2>Comment</h2></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cardboard / paper</td>
                    <td>Newspapers, magazines, cardboard food containers, mail, non-coated wrapping paper, etc.</td>
                    <td class="comment">Widely recycled across the country.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Thin plastic sheet</td>
                    <td>Cling film, food wrapping, plastic bags, etc.</td>
                    <td class="comment">Dependant on type of platsic, check your local authority website.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Formed plastic</td>
                    <td>Plastic bottles, bottle caps, food containers, etc.</td>
                    <td class="comment">Dependant on type of platsic, check your local authority website.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Glass</td>
                    <td>Glass bottles, coloured glass, etc.</td>
                    <td class="comment">Widely recycled across the country. DO NOT put broken glass in bin.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Aluminium</td>
                    <td>Foil, cans, metal lids, etc.</td>
                    <td class="comment">Widely recycled across the country.</td>
                </tr>

            <h2>An Introduction</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Image of Alysha Johnson, owner and writer of 'A Journey to Greeen',"

            <p>Hello and welcome!</p>
            <br>
            <p> My name is Alysha and I am looking to become greener and more sustainable. I invite you to join me on my
                journey and hopefully learn with me along the way. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The purpose of this blog is to provide a forum and start a conversation around sustainability. I want to
                make it easy, fun and accessible to all, not just to those that are "all in". </p>
            <br>
            <p>For me this isn't about becoming an activist or extremist but to take small actions to improve the way I
                give back to the planet we live on, whilst sharing these to help others do the same.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are lots of ideas flying around my head which I want to try, but feedback is important and I would
                love to hear from you. I have a "Contact Me" page where I would appreciate any feedback or even ideas to
                try.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I want to end with a reminder, not just for myself but to anyone reading this: we are human, we are
                going to make mistakes, not get it right first time and that is ok. This blog is about learning and as
                long as we are doing that we are doing the right thing.</p>
