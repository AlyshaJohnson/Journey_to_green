## 1. Design and Development

For the design of this website, the 5 pillars of User Experience Design (UXD) were used to cover the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface to make sure the design is intuitive, simple and enjoyable.

### 1.1 Strategy

The target user audience…

Interviews and workshops with users and stakeholders were conducted to understand their requirements and perspectives.

Research was conducted …

### 1.2 Scope

From the research and interviews conducted with the target audience and stakeholders, user stories were created to determine the flow of the app. The focus was put on the following user stories:

![User Stories 1 - 3](<insert image location>)
![User Stories 4 - 5](<insert image location>)

### 1.3 Structure

From the user stories, content, data, features and functionality can be determined.

**For the content:**


**For the data:**


**For the features / functionality:**


### 1.4 Skeleton

When the structure of the app, information and features had been determined, a wireframe for each view could be created:

<insert view of app/website>

### 1.5 Surface

**Colour Palette**

![Colour Palette](./assets/images/Readme-color.jpeg)

- The website's primary colours are (from left to right) #13443E, #EFEFEF, #F4D1AF and #E86E4C as seen in the picture above. They were derived using the online tool [colormind](http://colormind.io/), to make sure they complement and contrast. The colors are all nuances of green or orange, to mirror nature and enhance the connection with the being green.
- #13443E is used for headlines and text throughtout the quiz, unless a hyperlink, and as a border colour to emphasise buttons or sections of text. On hover and selection, all buttons turn the colour #13443E to show they are active. It is also used, in conjunction with an opacity of 0.5, as an overlay when the instructions pop-up is active.
- #EFEFEF is used as the main background colour for the webpage, the instructions pop up and on buttons. On selection or hover on buttons, the text is changed to #EFEFEF to contrast with it's background.
- #F4D1AF is used as a contrasting background color for the question and results sections.
- #E86E4C is used minimally to highlight links away from the quiz. It is a brighter colour to contrast with the green.

**Typography**
- Quicksand is used for headings and header elements. The fallback font is sans serif.
- Dosis is used for all other text elements including paragraphs, button labels, lists, etc. The fallback font is sans serif.
- Both fonts are from Google Fonts.

## 3. Testing

### 3.1 Initial Developer Testing

<introduce developer testing>

The development of this app was conducted on Google Chrome, therefore extensive testing was conducted on this browser. This was used as a benchmark against Firefox and Safari.

The elements of testing conducted on each browser are:
<insert list of testing performed and why - see example below>
- User Experience - what does the quiz look like; is the flow through the quiz the same; are all elements where they are expected?
- Functionality - do the buttons work as expected; does the question counter count?
- Performance - how responsive is the site?
- Other - this includes spelling and grammatical errors.

The user experience is consistent on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The instruction videos in Safari do not load - this bug has been captured.

Responsive design is important, CSS code had to be amended and adjusted to make sure the app could work on a number of devices. There were a number of user experience bugs that were produced when testing. These have now been fixed in the code.

### 3.2 Validator Testing

Using tools such as W3C validator, Jigsaw and Lighthouse gives visibility of any code, scripts or elements that are causing any errors. The results for the site are as follows:

**HTML**
- <insert report number> errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](<insert link to report>)

**CSS**
- <insert report number> errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](<insert link to report>)

**JS**
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check for errors in the JS code.
- For script.js, there were <insert report number> errors and <insert report number> warnings.
- For instructions.js, there were <insert report number> errors and <insert report number> warnings.
<insert any methods used to reduce number of errors and warnings>

**Performance**
- Results can be seen through the official [Lighthouse](<insert link to report>) report.

As part of the performance test through Lighthouse, some changes were made:
- Accessibility (aria-label) tags were implemented on all buttons to improve the score from 82 to 100.
- The cache policy was amended to increase the length of number of seconds the browser should cache the resource.
- The image file sizes needed to be compressed so reduce the impact on performance. This was successfully done using [tinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

### 3.3 User Testing
This app has been tested by a small group of 10 users in which some feedback was captured in the design and some errors in functionality and spelling were corrected.

UI improvements made:

Errors / bug fixes:
- <list errors/bugs that were found, what the problem was and how they were fixed>

### 3.4 Unfixed Bugs

## 4. Deployment

The ‘<insert website name>’ was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
